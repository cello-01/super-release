# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design and get user approval.

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT invoke any implementation skill, write any code, scaffold any project, or take any implementation action until you have presented a design and the user has approved it. This applies to EVERY project regardless of perceived simplicity.
</HARD-GATE>

## Anti-Pattern: "This Is Too Simple To Need A Design"

Every project goes through this process. A todo list, a single-function utility, a config change — all of them. "Simple" projects are where unexamined assumptions cause the most wasted work. The design can be short (a few sentences for truly simple projects), but you MUST present it and get approval.

## Checklist

You MUST create a task for each of these items and complete them in order:

1. **Explore project context** — check files, docs, recent commits
2. **Offer visual companion** (if topic will involve visual questions) — this is its own message, not combined with a clarifying question. See the Visual Companion section below.
3. **Ask clarifying questions** — one at a time, understand purpose/constraints/success criteria
4. **Propose 2-3 approaches** — with trade-offs and your recommendation
5. **Present design** — in sections scaled to their complexity, get user approval after each section
6. **Set up development branch and feature branch** — detect or ask for dev branch, create feature branch (see Development Branch Setup below)
7. **Write design doc** — save to `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md` and commit
8. **Spec self-review** — quick inline check for placeholders, contradictions, ambiguity, scope (see below)
9. **User reviews written spec** — ask user to review the spec file before proceeding
10. **Transition to implementation** — invoke writing-plans skill to create implementation plan

}
```

**The terminal state is invoking writing-plans.** Do NOT invoke frontend-design, mcp-builder, or any other implementation skill. The ONLY skill you invoke after brainstorming is writing-plans.

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**

- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Before asking detailed questions, assess scope: if the request describes multiple independent subsystems (e.g., "build a platform with chat, file storage, billing, and analytics"), flag this immediately. Don't spend questions refining details of a project that needs to be decomposed first.
- If the project is too large for a single spec, help the user decompose into sub-projects: what are the independent pieces, how do they relate, what order should they be built? Then brainstorm the first sub-project through the normal design flow. Each sub-project gets its own spec → plan → implementation cycle.
- For appropriately-scoped projects, ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too
- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**

- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the design:**

- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design
- Scale each section to its complexity: a few sentences if straightforward, up to 200-300 words if nuanced
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

**Design for isolation and clarity:**

- Break the system into smaller units that each have one clear purpose, communicate through well-defined interfaces, and can be understood and tested independently
- For each unit, you should be able to answer: what does it do, how do you use it, and what does it depend on?
- Can someone understand what a unit does without reading its internals? Can you change the internals without breaking consumers? If not, the boundaries need work.
- Smaller, well-bounded units are also easier for you to work with - you reason better about code you can hold in context at once, and your edits are more reliable when files are focused. When a file grows large, that's often a signal that it's doing too much.

**Working in existing codebases:**

- Explore the current structure before proposing changes. Follow existing patterns.
- Where existing code has problems that affect the work (e.g., a file that's grown too large, unclear boundaries, tangled responsibilities), include targeted improvements as part of the design - the way a good developer improves code they're working in.
- Don't propose unrelated refactoring. Stay focused on what serves the current goal.

## Before Creating Files: Development Branch Setup

After the user approves the design and before writing any files, set up the development branch and create a feature branch.

**Announce:** "Setting up the development branch and feature branch before we create files."

### Detect Development Branch

Check for existing local or `origin` development branches:

```bash
# Print the highest-priority matching branch, preserving local vs origin/<name>
git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short)' refs/heads refs/remotes/origin | awk '
  $0 == "origin/HEAD" { next }
  {
    branch = $0
    name = branch
    sub(/^origin\//, "", name)
    if (name !~ /^(dev|develop|development|staging|next)$/) next

    priority = (name == "dev" ? 1 : name == "develop" ? 2 : name == "development" ? 3 : name == "staging" ? 4 : 5)
    priorities[name] = priority
    if (!(name in matches) || branch !~ /^origin\//) matches[name] = branch
  }
  END {
    for (i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
      for (name in priorities) {
        if (priorities[name] == i) {
          print matches[name]
          exit
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

**If a development branch was found (local or remote):**
- If output is `origin/<name>`: `git checkout -b <name> origin/<name>`
- If local: `git checkout <name>`
- Update: if `origin/<name>` exists after checkout, run `git pull --ff-only origin <name>`
- Report: "Using existing development branch: `<name>`."

**If only `main` or `master` exists, ask the user:**

> "I don't see a dedicated development branch. Which branch should feature branches start from?"
>
> 1. `main` — merge features directly to main (GitHub Flow)
> 2. `dev` — create a new `dev` branch (recommended)
> 3. `develop` — create a new `develop` branch (Git Flow)
> 4. Custom name — I'll tell you

Wait for the user's response. If they choose a new branch:

```bash
BASE_BRANCH=$(
  git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/main && echo main ||
  git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/master && echo master ||
  git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/remotes/origin/main && echo origin/main ||
  git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/remotes/origin/master && echo origin/master
)

if [ -z "$BASE_BRANCH" ]; then
  echo "No main or master branch found; ask the user which branch to use."
elif [[ "$BASE_BRANCH" == origin/* ]]; then
  LOCAL_BASE=${BASE_BRANCH#origin/}
  git checkout -b "$LOCAL_BASE" "$BASE_BRANCH"
else
  git checkout "$BASE_BRANCH"
fi

git checkout -b <chosen-name>
```

Treat the user's selected starting branch as `<dev-branch>` in the following steps. For GitHub Flow, `<dev-branch>` may be `main`.

**If this is a new repository with no branches:**
Create `main` first, then ask the user which development branch to use.

### Create Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout <dev-branch>
git checkout -b feature/<topic-name>
```

Derive `<topic-name>` from the design topic — kebab-case, short, descriptive (e.g., `add-task-manager`, `fix-date-format`).

Report: "Feature branch `feature/<topic-name>` created from `<dev-branch>`. Writing the design spec now."

Then continue to **Documentation** below.

### Red Flags

**Never:**
- Write any file before the feature branch is created
- Create a feature branch from a branch other than the selected starting branch
- Proceed without confirming the development branch (don't guess)

**Always:**
- Check for existing development branches before asking the user
- Use kebab-case for feature branch names derived from the design topic
- Pull latest changes from remote before creating the feature branch

## After the Design

**Documentation:**

- Write the validated design (spec) to `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
  - (User preferences for spec location override this default)
- Use elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely skill if available
- Commit the design document to git

**Spec Self-Review:**
After writing the spec document, look at it with fresh eyes:

1. **Placeholder scan:** Any "TBD", "TODO", incomplete sections, or vague requirements? Fix them.
2. **Internal consistency:** Do any sections contradict each other? Does the architecture match the feature descriptions?
3. **Scope check:** Is this focused enough for a single implementation plan, or does it need decomposition?
4. **Ambiguity check:** Could any requirement be interpreted two different ways? If so, pick one and make it explicit.

Fix any issues inline. No need to re-review — just fix and move on.

**User Review Gate:**
After the spec review loop passes, ask the user to review the written spec before proceeding:

> "Spec written and committed to `<path>`. Please review it and let me know if you want to make any changes before we start writing out the implementation plan."

Wait for the user's response. If they request changes, make them and re-run the spec review loop. Only proceed once the user approves.

**Implementation:**

- Invoke the writing-plans skill to create a detailed implementation plan
- Do NOT invoke any other skill. writing-plans is the next step.

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** - Present design, get approval before moving on
- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense

## Visual Companion

A browser-based companion for showing mockups, diagrams, and visual options during brainstorming. Available as a tool — not a mode. Accepting the companion means it's available for questions that benefit from visual treatment; it does NOT mean every question goes through the browser.

**Offering the companion:** When you anticipate that upcoming questions will involve visual content (mockups, layouts, diagrams), offer it once for consent:
> "Some of what we're working on might be easier to explain if I can show it to you in a web browser. I can put together mockups, diagrams, comparisons, and other visuals as we go. This feature is still new and can be token-intensive. Want to try it? (Requires opening a local URL)"

**This offer MUST be its own message.** Do not combine it with clarifying questions, context summaries, or any other content. The message should contain ONLY the offer above and nothing else. Wait for the user's response before continuing. If they decline, proceed with text-only brainstorming.

**Per-question decision:** Even after the user accepts, decide FOR EACH QUESTION whether to use the browser or the terminal. The test: **would the user understand this better by seeing it than reading it?**

- **Use the browser** for content that IS visual — mockups, wireframes, layout comparisons, architecture diagrams, side-by-side visual designs
- **Use the terminal** for content that is text — requirements questions, conceptual choices, tradeoff lists, A/B/C/D text options, scope decisions

A question about a UI topic is not automatically a visual question. "What does personality mean in this context?" is a conceptual question — use the terminal. "Which wizard layout works better?" is a visual question — use the browser.

If they agree to the companion, read the detailed guide before proceeding:
`skills/brainstorming/visual-companion.md`
